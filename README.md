I love web development and currently I am working with a project with Angular 6, however I was always struggling to make my css work fine, so I decided to take a course in order to make my life easier.

I bought the course below, developed by jonasschmedtmann at Udemy and I am enjoying it a lot :)

I am learning nice CSS techniques by making the three projects below:

https://nexter.netlify.com/ <br />

So this is an repository to store the code of these projects :).
