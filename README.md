I love web development (HTML, JS and CSS), however I was always struggling to make my css work fine, so I decided to take a course in order to make my life easier.

I bought the course below, developed by jonasschmedtmann at Udemy and I am enjoying it a lot :)

https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/.

I am learning nice CSS techniques by making the three projects below:

http://trillo.netlify.com/ <br />
https://nexter.netlify.com/ <br />

So this is an repository to store the code of these projects and some concepts I am learning :).
